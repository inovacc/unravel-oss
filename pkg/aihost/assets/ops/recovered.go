  Pre-enrichment classifier. Skips boilerplate modules (icon factories,
  re-exports, lazy bindings, vendored chunks) before they burn LLM
  quota. Tags each pending module as ENRICH / STATIC_OK / SKIP and
  optionally writes static-only enrichments for SKIP rows.
`,
			Body: `# unravel-triage

Quota-saving filter. Inspects pending modules, classifies each, and
either marks for full enrichment or writes a static-only summary.

## Inputs

| arg          | meaning                                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| app          | KB app slug (required)                               |
| limit        | how many pending rows to triage (default 200)        |
| apply        | 0 or 1 - persist static-only rows for SKIP class     |
| min_body     | min body bytes to consider ENRICH (default 256)      |

## Classification rules

| Class        | Heuristic                                                     |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| SKIP         | body < min_body OR body matches vendored sha set OR body is pure re-export pattern (only n.d + n.r) |
| STATIC_OK    | role inferrable from body shape (icon factory, lazy-binding wrapper, GraphQL fragment-only) - write static summary  |
| ENRICH       | everything else - leave for unravel-enricher                  |

## Workflow

1. ` + "`unravel kb enrich pending`" + ` (app, limit, body_cap=512 for cheap scan).
2. For each module: apply classifier rules. To seed the vendored sha set, run ` + "`unravel kb catalog query`" + ` with a ` + "`GROUP BY body_sha256 HAVING COUNT(*) >= N`" + ` aggregate (no dedicated CLI verb exists for this yet).
3. If apply=1, write static-only enrichment via
   ` + "`unravel kb enrich write-enrichment`" + ` for STATIC_OK class (model_used="triage-static").
4. Report class breakdown + estimated quota saved.

## Output

` + "```" + `
triage report - <timestamp>
app=<app> scanned=<N>
SKIP=<A> STATIC_OK=<B> ENRICH=<C>
estimated_quota_saved=<A+B> modules
written=<B> static-only enrichments (if apply=1)
` + "```" + `

## Required commands (run via Bash)

` + "`unravel kb enrich pending`" + `, ` + "`unravel kb enrich write-enrichment`" + `,
` + "`unravel kb catalog query`" + ` (for vendored-hash detection), Read.

## Out of scope

- Does NOT enrich ENRICH-class rows (that is unravel-enricher's job).
- Does NOT delete or modify already-summarised rows.

Session-restart triage. Pulls recent enrich activity, identifies the
work-in-progress slice, recommends a single concrete command to
continue.

## Inputs

| arg     | meaning                                                  |

| window  | how many recent runs to inspect (default 5)              |

## Workflow

1. There is no dedicated CLI verb for enrich-run status yet; run ` + "`unravel kb catalog query`" + ` against the ` + "`enrich_runs`" + ` table (ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT <window>) to pull the last <window> runs.
2. For each run, classify: completed / in_progress / stalled.
3. Pull ` + "`unravel kb catalog stats`" + ` + ` + "`unravel kb enrich pending`" + ` count per app.
4. Pick the highest-leverage continuation:
   - any stalled run > 10min heartbeat -> recommend /unravel:retry
   - any app with pending > 0 and last completed run < 1h ago -> recommend /unravel:enrich same app same batch_size
   - all caught up -> recommend /unravel:doctor + /unravel:pending
5. Emit recommendation block.

## Output

Core deliverable agent. Reads the KB for an app and produces a

## Inputs

## Workflow

1. Pull modules via ` + "`unravel kb catalog search`" + ` + ` + "`unravel kb catalog dump`" + `. Filter by
   role in (auth, protocol, storage, telemetry, ipc).
2. Run signature scans across module bodies and side_effects:

   - weak_crypto: MD5, SHA1, DES, ECB
   - screen_evasion: setContentProtection, allow-set-content-protected

3. Cross-reference with ` + "`unravel kb catalog facts`" + ` for known IOCs.

`,
			Body: `# unravel-corpus-grower

Long-running autonomous enrichment loop. Picks targets by leverage,
runs bounded work per wake-up, reports cumulative growth.

## Inputs

| arg           | meaning                                              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| max_minutes   | upper bound per wake-up (default 30)                 |
| max_passes    | enrich passes per wake-up (default 4)                |
| batch_size    | modules per subagent (default 5)                     |
| limit_per_pass| modules per pass (default 25)                        |
| quota_cap     | abort wake-up at N total enrichments (default 200)   |

## Target selection

For each app in ` + "`unravel kb catalog apps`" + `:
- Compute leverage = pending * (1 / (summarised + 1)) - bigger backlog + smaller existing coverage wins.
- Skip apps with pending < 10 (drained).
- Pick app with highest leverage.

## Workflow per wake-up

1. ` + "`unravel kb catalog apps`" + ` + ` + "`unravel kb catalog stats`" + ` -> target selection.
2. Loop until max_passes OR max_minutes OR quota_cap reached:
   - ` + "`unravel kb enrich pending`" + ` (target, limit_per_pass).
   - Split into batches, dispatch Task fan-out to unravel-enricher.
   - Persist via ` + "`unravel kb enrich write-enrichment`" + `.
   - Record pass result (track cumulative counts locally; there is no dedicated run-status CLI verb yet — use ` + "`unravel kb catalog query`" + ` against ` + "`enrich_runs`" + ` if a persistent record is needed). If failed_rate > 30 percent, abort early.
3. Emit growth report.

## Output

` + "```" + `
corpus-grower wake-up <timestamp>
target=teams (leverage=A)
passes_run=<N>/<max> elapsed=<S>m
enriched=<E> failed=<F> rate=<R> mod/min
coverage_delta: pending <X>->Y> summarised <A>-><B> (+<E>)
next_wake: <suggested cron>
` + "```" + `

## Scheduling

Designed to be invoked by /unravel:grow which can be wrapped in
/loop or ScheduleWakeup for daily autonomy. The agent itself is
stateless across wakes - reads state from KB each invocation.

## Required commands (run via Bash)

` + "`unravel kb catalog apps`" + `, ` + "`unravel kb catalog stats`" + `, ` + "`unravel kb enrich pending`" + `,
` + "`unravel kb enrich write-enrichment`" + `, ` + "`unravel kb catalog query`" + ` (run-status; no
dedicated verb yet), Task.

## Out of scope

- Does NOT exceed quota_cap in a single wake-up.
- Does NOT run when quota_guard says insufficient (defers to next wake).
- Does NOT modify configs or env vars.

`,
			Body: `# /unravel:heal

Operational repair. Runs diagnostics, classifies findings, applies
safe fixes when ` + "`fix=1`" + `. Default is REPORT-ONLY. Delegates to the
` + "`unravel-self-healer`" + ` subagent.

## Arguments

| key     | default | meaning                                              |

Unknown-arg validation: abort with

## Execute

1. Parse + validate args.
2. Dispatch one Task call with ` + "`subagent_type=\"unravel:unravel-self-healer\"`" + ` and parsed args.
3. Stream the subagent's report (FIXED / HINT / HUMAN / PASS rows).
4. If verdict=DEGRADED or FAILED and ` + "`fix=0`" + `, suggest re-running with ` + "`fix=1`" + `.

## Safety

The subagent NEVER restarts Postgres, the MCP server, or modifies
` + "`~/.claude/settings.json`" + ` beyond what ` + "`unravel plugin install`" + ` does.
NEEDS_HUMAN items always surface as actionable hints, never auto-applied.

## Execute

1. Parse + validate.

## Best practice

Always run ` + "`/unravel:triage apply=1`" + ` BEFORE the first
` + "`/unravel:enrich`" + ` on a freshly-dissected app. Saves 30-50 percent of
quota on typical Electron bundles where vendored React + icon-factory
