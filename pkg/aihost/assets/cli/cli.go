  Reference for the unravel binary's command surface. The plugin no longer
  registers per-verb tools for agents to call directly — every operation now
  runs as an ` + "`" + `unravel <group> <verb>` + "`" + ` invocation via Bash. Invoke this skill
  whenever an agent or slash command needs to know which unravel subcommand
  to run, what a group's available verbs are, or how to keep large command
  output out of the conversation.

# unravel-cli — command surface reference

unravel ships as a single Cobra binary. There is no separate tool registry
to look up any more: every capability is a subcommand, invoked directly via
Bash.

## The mapping rule

Any capability that used to be exposed as a per-verb tool follows one
naming convention: **the tool's group and verb become the CLI's group and
verb.** A tool named for a group and a verb maps onto
` + "`" + `unravel <group> <verb>` + "`" + `. For example, a java-decompile capability becomes
` + "`" + `unravel java decompile` + "`" + `, a kb-enrich-pending capability becomes
` + "`" + `unravel kb enrich pending` + "`" + `, and an app-detect capability becomes
` + "`" + `unravel app detect` + "`" + `. When in doubt, run ` + "`" + `unravel <group> --help` + "`" + ` to confirm the
exact verb spelling and flags before invoking it.

## Discovering the surface live

The authoritative command list is always the binary itself, not this
document (subcommands are added over time):

` + "`" + `` + "`" + `` + "`" + `bash
unravel --help                # top-level group list
unravel <group> --help        # verbs available inside a group
unravel <group> <verb> --help # flags for one verb
` + "`" + `` + "`" + `` + "`" + `

## Verbs for the groups agents call most often

- ` + "`" + `android` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `info` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `extract` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `static verify|cert|decompile|dex2jar` + "`" + `,
  ` + "`" + `tools status|apktool|jadx|retdec|bundletool|adb` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `java` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `info` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `decompile` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `extract` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `manifest` + "`" + `,
  ` + "`" + `beautify` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `compare` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `dotnet` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `info` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `deps` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `runtime` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `ipc` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `decompile` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `asar` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `dump` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `extract` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `list` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `search` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `kb` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `build` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `catalog` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `curated` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `drift` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `enrich` + "`" + `,
  ` + "`" + `findings` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `gaps` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `ops` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `transfer` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `capture` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `start` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `list` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `diff` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `replay` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `cert` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `info` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `extract` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `verify` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `compare` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `scan` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `frida` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `generate` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `from-seams` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `run` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `validate` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `garble` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `detect` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `info` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `strings` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `symbols` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `scan` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `transpile` + "`" + ` — no subcommands, takes a file directly:
  ` + "`" + `unravel transpile <file> [--language <lang>] [--offline]` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `app` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `detect` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `dissect` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `scan` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `schema` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `forensic` + "`" + `,
  ` + "`" + `heuristic` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `inject` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `reconstruct` + "`" + `
- ` + "`" + `npm` + "`" + ` — ` + "`" + `info` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `download` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `analyze` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `deps` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `batch` + "`" + `,
  ` + "`" + `diff` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `mcp` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `probe` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `sandbox` + "`" + `

These lists drift as unravel grows — treat them as a starting point and
confirm with ` + "`" + `unravel <group> --help` + "`" + ` before relying on an exact verb or flag
name.

## Context discipline (mandatory)

Every group supports ` + "`" + `--json` + "`" + ` for machine-parseable output and
` + "`" + `-o` + "`" + `/` + "`" + `--output <dir>` + "`" + ` to write results to disk instead of stdout. When a
command's raw output could be large (APK/JAR/bundle contents, KB dumps,
decompiled trees):

1. Prefer ` + "`" + `--output <dir>` + "`" + ` so bulk output lands on disk, not in the
   conversation.
2. When you do need stdout, add ` + "`" + `--json` + "`" + ` and pipe through a summarizer
   (e.g. jq, or a short script) rather than printing the raw payload.
3. Never paste a full raw dump into the conversation — summarize counts,
   key findings, and file paths instead.

## Out of scope

- This skill does not execute anything itself — it only tells you which
  ` + "`" + `unravel <group> <verb>` + "`" + ` to run via Bash.
- It is not a substitute for ` + "`" + `unravel <group> --help` + "`" + `, which is always the
  ground truth for flags and subcommand spelling.
